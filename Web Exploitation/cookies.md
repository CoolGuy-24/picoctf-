# Cookies
The name of the challenge suggested that the flag must have something to do with cookies. I knew that cookies are packets of data that a website uses to store information.

I also knew that using the inspect element we can access the developer settings of a website. So that is what I did intitally. I opened up the cookies website and then:
- Right-clicked and selected inspect
- Went to `Sources` tab and checked the JavaSript file to see if the flag was hidden there
- Went to `Application` tab and checked under the `Cookies` section

From there I got to know the value of the cookie was set to -1. I didn't exactly know what it meant so I was checking other tabs to find the flag somewhere overe there. After several attempts to do so, I realised I didn't use the textbox yet to do anything else.

So I typed `snickerdoodle` as it was what was highlighted in the textbox and pressed on submit. The webpage loaded a green aleart like this:

I then searched up the term `snickerdoodle cookies` and tried various other prompts like `New England` (its origin), `flour`, `sugar` and then I got another success message with `sugar`

So then it struck me that the flag is not related to the snickerdoodle cookie, but maybe it gives the flag on a specific cookies name? So I started typing different cookie names like `peanut butter`, `chocolate chip`, `oatmeal raisin` and after several pother cookie names I realised this method was futile and there has to be another efficient way to do this.

I started reading up on web exploitation and was constantly coming across the application `Burp Suite` so I installed it on my laptop. The [Modifying HTTPS requests](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/modifying-http-requests) was one of the first examples that I was made familiar with.
I had to modify the value of the price tag of the leather jacket so that it could be bought for just one cent and after doing this example, it struck me that I could do something similiar with cookies as well.

So after getting familiarised with modifying https requests which is done by:
- Opening the website in Burp Browser
- Switching `Intercept` on under the `Proxy` tab just before you want to analyse the request
- Then modify the request and slect `Forward all`
- Switch off the intercept

I opened up the website in Burp Browser and started intercepting the requests and changing the cookie values from 0 (which is snickerdoodle). Some of my results with cookie values are listed below.

Cookie: 3

Cookie: 10

Finally on cookie value 18, I was met with this output which gave me the flag.

Flag: `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_bb3b3535}`

This is how I edited the cookie values:
