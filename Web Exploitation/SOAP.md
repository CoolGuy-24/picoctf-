This challenge had the tag of XXE, so I knew there had to be some use of it in this challenge. Using youtube I learnt XXE External Entities injection and what they are used for.
[XXE External Entities](https://youtu.be/gjm6VHZa_8s?si=cP3JNreJvnwBoI1m) helped me learn the following topics:
- XML stands for eXternal Markup Language which helps in structuring data and transportation of data.
- XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. 
- External Entities: They are placeholders for data similar to ids in HTML
- Document Type Definition (DTD): It defines the structure of the document with the correct elements and their type. They are of teo types, internal and external.
- XXE injection: It can be carried out using a custom made XML payload which can reveal sensitive information

Launching the challenge gave this webpage.

To see the XML data I opened up Burp Suite and started intercepting a request and sure enough after I clicked on the detail button of the `picoctf` image I could see the XML data.

Reading this GitHub page about [XML external entity (XXE) injection](https://github.com/payloadbox/xxe-injection-payload-list), I got an idea about how to make a custom payload to read the file. 
I sent the request to the repeater and wrote my custom payload as below.
