# C3
There were 2 files involved in this challenge. The first being the `ciphertext` file and the other being the econder file which was `convert.py`. 

Opening the `ciphertext` file gave this text:
```
DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl
```

The `convert.py` file had the following code:
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```

The first block of code helps gain input from the user, and then lookup1 and lookup are defined. The next block is where the encoding happens. What it does is basically lookups the character present in the input in lookup1 and then stores its index in `cur` (which stands for current) and then it encodes it using the formula `lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]` which subtracts the index of the `cur` and`prev` characters and divides it by 40 so that it is within the array length of lookup2.

Since the encoding process is now clear, I could write the decoding part, which basically had to be a reverse of this process. With some help, I was able to write the decrypting file.

```
# Define the lookup tables
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

# Function to decrypt the ciphertext
def decrypt_ciphertext(ciphertext):
    out = ""
    prev = 0  
    for char in ciphertext:
        cur = lookup2.index(char)  
        out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]  
        prev = (cur + prev) % 40  

    return out

# Take ciphertext input from the user
ciphertext = input("Enter the ciphertext: ")

# Decrypt and print the plaintext
plaintext = decrypt_ciphertext(ciphertext)
print("Decrypted text:", plaintext)
```


Running this code, I was able to decode the `ciphertext` file to this:

```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```

Reading the first block, I understood that the code is written in python2 so i converted it into python3. The code is basically trying to extarct only those characters which are present at indices which are a perfect cube. So all I had to do was make a script, which extracted the characters which had an index which was a cube number.


```
# Open the file and read its contents
with open('decrypt.txt', 'r') as file:
    chars = file.read()  

b = 1/1
output = ""

# Loop through the characters and extract those at cubic indices
for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b**3:  
        output += chars[i]  
        b += 1  

# Print the decrypted message
print(output)

```

After doing that, I was inputting the file as `ciphertext.txt` which gave me the output `LgHDPt` and trying this didn't work on picoCTF. So after thinking, I tried with the python2 script as the input and it did work, providing me with the output `adlibs`

`Flag: picoCTF{adlibs}`
