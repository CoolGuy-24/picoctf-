# Format String 0
The challenge name suggested that obtaining the flag must have something to do with formatting strings. So keeping that in mind, I looked at the files that were provided. 

There were 2 files with the name `format-string-0`. One was a C file and the other was a binary file. There was a connection link provided here as well, so using that I ran the program in the terminal. In this case, the link was `nc mimas.picoctf.net 64436`

This was the output of the program when you connect to it and run it. 


After experimenting with putting the burgr names, I realised that there would be many choices that I could make and a better way to approach this would be to have a look at the code of the program.

Opening the C file, I got to know the condition in which the order can be fulfilled. The `if` condition would only be true if the `count` variable has greater value than the `BUFSIZE` variable.

From here we can see that the `BUFSIZE` is 32 only, and twice that would be 64. So to exceed the size, we need to select an option that would be greater than 64 in size.

Out of the three available burgers the format specifier `%d` is present in the burger named `Gr%114d_Cheese` which essentially means that the length becomes 114, which is greater than 64, so I selected that burger and upon doing so I got the following output:

There was again a choice of three burgers so I went back to the code again so see if there is any condition that needs to be satisfied to reveal the flag. I could not find any such condition so I simply tried to input all three burger choices and see the result.

```

The burger named `Cla%ssic_Che%s%steak` gave the flag. This left me wondering as to why, did this only result in the flag? After thinking carefully, I noticed that the output mentioned `outrageous` which maybe referred to somethin gbreaking apart and out of the 3 burgers the only burger name tha could trigger an error was `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` cause it had a format specifier of a string `%s` in it whereas the other burger names didn't.

Flag: `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}`
