# Buffer Overflow 0
The challenge name sugegested that the flag has to be obtained with somehow overflowing the buffer. This means that the buffer would store data with capacity more than its storage capacity. 

When the challenge was launched two files were downloaded, `vuln.c` which was the source code and `vuln` which was the program. There was also a mention of a connection link to connect to run the program, which in my case was `nc saturn.picoctf.net 59923`

Now I knew that we need to overflow the buffer somehow so I opened the source file and started analysing the code in the C file. 

I noticed that when the `vuln()` function is called, it copies the input of `buf2` into `buf1` using `strcpy()`. The problem here would bethat even though `buf1` has a size of 100, `buf2` only has a size of 16, so if anything more than 16 characters is entered than the buffer would overflow giving us the flag.

So that is exactly what I tried, and I was able to obtain the flag easily.
```
coolguy24@Vedant-Laptop:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 59923
Input: 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```

Flag: `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}`
